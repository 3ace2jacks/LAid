# LAid - Lecture Aid

A running version of this application can be found at [laid.cool](http://laid.cool).

## Introduction
This is the project of group 93 in TDT4140 Software Engineering at NTNU 2017.

The application will aid lecturers before, during and after lectures. 

The lecturer creates quizzes before lectures that the students take. This makes sure the students are somewhat prepared before lecture, and the lecturer can see what topics the students struggle with.

During lecture the students can ask questions in real-time, and notify the lecturer of whether or not the lecture speed is appropriate.

After the lectures the lecturer can create a quiz that the students can take to repeat the content, and the lecturer can see what the students learned. 

## Running the application
The application consists of two separate applications, a front-end and a back-end. How to build the application is found in the README of each of the frontend and backend.
